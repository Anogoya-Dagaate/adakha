	<p id="bio">I was born on the first of September <strong>1981</strong> it seems ominous to me because
		This is all that remains for me, a man. Men are cursed with the search for order and meaning.
		like the woman in the novel who can forgive her husbands infidelity but simply cannot accept
		her place exchanged for nothing! Nothing? He left me because I was worse than nothing?
		Another woman is dignifying - if she's attractive, sadistically more so. 
		'The Pig!' He'll leave after my own beauty had waned from
		bringing to life <em>his seed</em> Such impudence!</p>
	<p id="bio1">
		One of my earliest memories growing up was the sense of beauty - I was a sensitive child. A mystic from birth
		I cried freely, at music, at suffering - an almost existential sorrow. I was keenly aware that man suffered.
		Not that this suffering was inevitable - for we had TV's! There was a place where food came out of ovens and fridges 
		held leftovers. I somehow knew though - that such a place was not mine, worse yet - that mine was envied!
		A nascent spirituality overlaid all my experience hence; that a God must obtain and the same understand and distribute
	as seemeth fit</p>

			Portrait of the philosopher . . . as a young man!
			Such a curious thing, that birds should yet preserve feet
			as if they numbered among the wingless!
			<p>	
			If you commit to the difficult path - without recourse to shortcuts
			An easier path may yet be revealed; if you reject the hard-road even
			it assumes impossibility which in truth is but long and painful
			</p>
			<p>
			It behoves the man to commit to such as he must. Its a sure path to 
			damnation this search for shortcuts.

		<p>The challenge faced in learning is one of humility.
		 I just spent a couple of hours, at least one changing a "\" to a "/".
		 Now I could have saved that entire hour if I had not assumed such a foolish error below my 'pay grade'.</p>

		<p>May God grant us always the humility to remember how weak and unstable we are;
		how helpless and hapless without His aid</p>

	<h3 class="uppercase singfy">
		<p>Szegedy-Mazsak represents for me the great chaos</p>
	</h3>
		<p>Of our human existence. That a people who have so rejected
		Their God should without repentance suffer in his name beyond
		reconciliation.
		<img src=".\paul.png">
		The verdict may be that light came into the world but men preferred
		darkness - certainly from malice but surely also from ignorance and
		stupidity. The terror of leaving ones cave with its familiar smells
		and satisfactions like Graham Greens unforgetable description of 
		masturbating prisoners.
		<p>
		What is this we call the Jew? Who is he and what crime hash
		Done, what sin adjudged guilty of?
		The thing of which I'm bothered is this - that men should
		entertain sin at all - here's a thing at once cancerous and
		of insurmountable vitality - to bring such forth? Why one might
		as well wish for ones own death - which indeed one does!
	</p>
	<p>
		The miracle is that anything should be able to undo the ravages
		of sin - it is an immolation. The organism succumbing to its own
		death in hopes that in resurrection the agent of torment having
		perished should no longer rise with this new life.
